            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project involves building a chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain to simplify the analysis of research papers. The system processes content, stores it in Pinecone for vector-based retrieval, and uses OpenAI to generate context-aware responses to user queries. The goal is to make research paper comprehension efficient and interactive.

        <section>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable users to extract meaningful insights from research papers efficiently.</li>
                <li>Use vector-based storage for quick and accurate document retrieval.</li>
                <li>Provide context-aware responses using OpenAI’s advanced language models.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p>
                The content of research papers is pre-processed and embedded into vector representations using OpenAI embeddings. These embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a high-performance vector database.
            </p>
            <h3>Query Processing</h3>
            <p>
                When a user asks a question, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant document chunks from Pinecone. The retrieved information is then passed to OpenAI’s GPT API to generate a natural language response.
            </p>
            <h3>Deployment</h3>
            <p>
                The system is deployed on a web interface that provides users with an intuitive way to upload documents, ask queries, and receive answers. This interface is built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> A web interface for user interactions, built with Streamlit.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pinecone for storing and retrieving vector embeddings of document content.</li>
                        <li>LangChain for orchestrating retrieval and response generation workflows.</li>
                        <li>OpenAI API for generating context-aware answers to user queries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Results -->
        <section>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                The chatbot was able to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers to queries based on uploaded research papers. This made the process of understanding complex documents simpler and more interactive.
