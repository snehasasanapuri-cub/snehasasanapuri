                    <p>
                        As a Machine Learning Engineer, I implemented advanced AI and ML solutions to enhance operational efficiency in submarine construction projects. Leveraging 
                        <strong>ensemble learning techniques (XGBoost)</strong>, I improved prediction accuracy and model robustness by 30% through hyperparameter tuning. 
                        I applied <strong>deep learning (CNN)</strong> to automate defect detection in radiographic test films, achieving 52% accuracy and replacing manual processes. 
                        Using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>NLP techniques</strong>, I automated feedback classification, reducing response times by 20% and expediting corrective actions. 
                        I also developed intelligent systems integrating <strong>AutoCAD, SQL, and AutoLISP</strong>, boosting workflow efficiency by 30%, and streamlined resource planning with 
                        <strong>Synchro 4D BIM scripting</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>PLM tools</strong>, improving planning efficiency by 31%. Additionally, I optimized <strong>SQL queries</strong> for 
                        <strong>Power BI</strong> integration, enabling real-time business insights and reducing query run-time by ~40%.
